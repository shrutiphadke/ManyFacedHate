# ManyFacedHate

### Data Description

###### We refer to Southern Poverty Law Center's list of hate groups in 2018 (https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map). This list contains the names of 367 hate groups along with their ideologies. Next, we manually identify and verify the accounts for each of the 367 organizations as follows. First, we conducted web searches with the organization’s name to find their corresponding website. In most cases, the website had direct links to their social media accounts. In other cases, we searched the organization’s name within the search interface of a social media platforms. We checked whether an account with similar name exists and whether the account’s bio had a reference to the organization’s website.
